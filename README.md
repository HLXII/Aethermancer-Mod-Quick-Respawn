# Aethermancer-Mod-Quick-Respawn
Bepinex mod for Aethermancer to spawn close to the cliff for the next run.

WARNING: I tested this after the initial tutorial. This may cause some weird behavior if you haven't triggered some of the initial dialogues.

# Build
Building locally requires various `.dll` files to be added to the `lib` directory. These files can be obtained from Bepinex and the data within `Aethermancer_Data/Managed`.

# Installation
Install [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). 

After, add the `.dll` from the latest releases to the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.
